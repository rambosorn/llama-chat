TechCorp Employee Handbook & Security Policy
Version: 2025.1

1. ID Badges
All employees must wear their ID badges at all times while on company premises. Lost badges must be reported to Security immediately.

2. Remote Work Policy
TechCorp embraces flexibility. Employees are permitted to work remotely on Fridays, provided they have manager approval and high-speed internet access.

3. AI & Data Usage
The use of external AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude) for company code or confidential data is STRICTLY PROHIBITED unless using the internal "TechCorp AI" sandbox. Data leakage is a fireable offense.

4. Working Hours
Core hours are 10:00 AM to 3:00 PM. Employees are expected to be available during these times regardless of their time zone.
