✨ AI ANSWER:
Based on the available records, I don't know based on the available records.

We have the monthly report from Account_Finance, which shows a Net Profit of $4,200,000 and the Finance budget is not specified in this document. We also have a document (project_pegasus.txt) that mentions a budget for Project Pegasus as $50,000,000. However, there is no direct link between these two documents, so I couldn't determine if the monthly net profit covers the total budget for Project Pegasus.
